# Nutrition Calculator

This is a really simple nutrition calculator built in Python made with the sole purpose of getting myself comfortable working with classes.

The following inputs are required:
* Name (string)
* Age (integer)
* Weight (integer, kg)
* Height (integer, cm)
* Sex Chromosomes (string, either XX or XY)
* Weight Goal (string, either Gain, Maintain or Lose)
* Activity Level (string, either Sedentry, Light, Moderate, Active or Extreme)

The calculator takes this data and prints:
* Base Metabolic Rate (no activity)
* Maintenance Calorie Requirement (based on activity level)
* Recommended Calorie Intake (based on weight goal)
* Body Mass Index

That's all there is to it for now.
