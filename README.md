# Nutrition Calculator

This is a really simple nutrition calculator built in Python made with the sole purpose of getting myself comfortable working with classes.

The following inputs are required:
* Name
* Age
* Weight(kg)
* Height(cm)
* Sex Chromosomes(XX or XY)
* Weight Goal (Gain, Maintain or Lose)
* Activity Level (Sedentry, Light, Moderate, Active or Extreme)

The calculator takes this data and prints:
* Base Metabolic Rate (no activity)
* Maintenance Calorie Requirement (based on activity level)
* Recommended Calorie Intake (based on weight goal)
* Body Mass Index

That's all there is to it for now.
